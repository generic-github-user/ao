# ap

*ao-python*

An alternative to the shell-based version of the ao codebase, which is
beginning to show issues with maintainability and scalability. Rust, Lisp, and
zx were also considered (among other languages), but Python's interoperability
and convenience made it the best choice for this next iteration. The core
philosophy is the same: track everything, always; and make things easier for
the user (myself in particular), even at the expense of speed or mathematical
elegance.
