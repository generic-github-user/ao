```

## Usage

TODO

## Features

A summary of ao's main features (note that not all of these have been implemented yet; these are marked `TODO`):

- Automated OCR on saved images and quick search for text in images
- Convenient tools for viewing sets of files generated by searches
- Automatic text file analysis
- Auto-tagging of files based on their name, location, content, etc. `TODO`
- Maintenance of a dynamic file database, including:
  - File hashes/checksums
  - File and directory statistics
  - Advanced file tagging that integrates with the native filesystem (e.g., the xargs attribute used by Dolphin and some other file managers) `TODO`
  - Automatic detection of file moves & copies `TODO`
  - Sophisticated tools for backup and archival that respect each file's history and metadata `TODO`
  - Integration with structured objects like git repositories `TODO`
- Reorganization of directory structures via simple rules
  - By filetype, tags, or other attributes
  - Based on content or relations to other files `TODO`
  - Using an optimization goal (e.g., reduce edit distance between filenames) `TODO`
- System notifications on completion of tasks
- Generic options with sensible interpretations for each command they apply to
- Temporary, persistent, and semi-persistent customization `TODO`
- Management of sensitive data like passwords via automated encryption and decryption of segmented files `TODO`
- Compatible with multiple input & output formats `TODO`
- Useful and adjustable logging `TODO`
- Flexible controls on memory and processor usage (and bandwidth) `TODO`
- Data hiding for sensitive files by repeatedly encrypting a file and spreading it over hundreds or thousands of shards embedded in a file system or on remote servers `TODO`

And some quality of life things:

- Plays nicely with standard input and output
- Always triple-checks before clobbering your files or performing any irreversible actions
- Reasonably clean shell (bash) code intended to be easily extensible
